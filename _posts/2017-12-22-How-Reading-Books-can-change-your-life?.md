I have been reading books since Class 9th although I used to read teen-fiction or mystery novels. The only reason I ever got into 
those books was because of a bit of sibling rivalry. My younger brother used to devour books since being born. He had a hunger for
knowledge which my parents hoped I could also follow. 

Although on paper it may look like I have been reading for 8-9 years, 
I made reading a habit only in 2016. That's when I started reading the right books. The books that would take me forward in life.
The books that held answers to my problems. Before that every book that I picked was either out of whim or good rating on an
e-commerce site. It wasn't easy to make reading a habit but it did got easier with time. Like Mark Zuckerberg I decided to 
read 1 book every 2 week. I told myself "If Mark can do it so can I" whenever an excuse like "I don't have time." popped into my
head. 

So I would sit down and read a book for 1 hour every day, no matter what. Initially, it was difficult to just sit down and focus.
My mind would wander and sometimes I would be stuck on a page for an hour. But I stayed to it and no matter what completed 1 book 
every 2 week. As the end of the year approached I realized I could think much more clearly that before. My thinking seemed to be 
much more profound. 
Moreover when I did get stuck at an issue that I couldn't resolve, I knew where I could find the information.I could of course read faster and sometimes could scan the page for just important points. 

Books became my mentors. I started  "the year of books" with fiction(percy jackson and sea of monsters). I considered it would
require less discipline to read a fiction book as your attention is naturally grasped by the writer. As I read more I became attracted
towards non-fiction and philosophy(life in general). Now the more I read, the hungrier I felt. The world that seemed a mystery to me was finally opening itself to me.

I read a quote somewhere *__" Every problem that you will ever face in the lifetime, already has a solution in some book. You just gotta find 
that book "__*

Reading the right books also made me rethink my life and where I was headed. I realized merely graduating and working 9-5 like all others around me,
was not my destiny. I believed I was destined for great stuff and wanted to make it happen. It made me choose a path of entrepreneurship and helped me learn
to keep walking on when no one would dare along with with you.
