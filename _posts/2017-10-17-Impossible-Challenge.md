I feel pretty bored.I am tired of learning new technologies.Everything seems similar and easy.It seems anything can be done if given
the right amount of time.I could go on and on but what is the point of it all.It's a cycle there is no end.

To cope up with this boredom I have decided on an impossible challenge.Why Impossible? Because I haven't achieved it before.
Challenge duration is 30 days from today(17th November 2017) and here are the things I am going to achieve.

1. Data Structure Foundation- IITbombayX
2. Data Structure Implementation - IITBombayX
3. Machine Learning -Coursera
4. Udacity Intro to Machine Learning
5. Attend PyCon Conference
6. FCC front end Certification
7. FCC BackEnd Certification
8. FCC Data Viz Certification
9. 10 successful PR fossasia
10. Read 1 book every week
11. Udemy Game dev course
12. 1 hr igmameproject everyday.
13. Projects started / Side projects.
14. Attempt to create  2 Projects a day which includes 2 games a week
15. Meet 1 new person every week.

All these seem to be pretty far fetched.I will most probably fail but I won't focus on that.I will focus on winning because winning
is a state of mind.Let's see how far I can reach.I will blog my daily progress, mistakes I did, How can it be avoided, What can
I do better and how can I make tomorrow more productive.Till then peace out. #ImpossibleChallenge
