Everything has changed. 
Things have become simple. 
Maybe because I have stopped 
Analysing stuff too much
And started embracing them as is. 

I suspect there is a role of 
meditation in this. 
And yoga plus constant desire to 
become self realized. 

As every day passes by. 
I feel I am upgrading. 
It's like a new software update,
is being pushed into my hardware
every day. 

I feel a like a new person,
I am faster, agile and intelligent, 
than I was ever before. 
I have become intuitive beyond, 
my wildest dreams. 

Things I thought I could never do
Now I can do in seconds.
I learn't to do handstand in 10 secs
Although I did do it for just 10 sec. 
But that's not the point. 
The point is I could always do it 
But I fooled myself into thinking, 
I never could 

How many of us do that to ourself 
everyday. 
We are capable of much more than we
think. 
Try this for a day. 
You are unstoppable force and you already
know everything you want to do 
and how to do it. 
And see the result yourself. 
Can I do a handstand. 
Answer is yes. 
The next question is how. 
The answer pops in like a snap. 
If it doesn't research  it. 

You are a soul connected to millions 
of others. 
You have access to all knowledge you
would require in a lifetime. 
Internet is a joke to complex network 
you could have command over. 
So be mindful and believe you are 
unstoppable within
