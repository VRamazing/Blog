As a child, I was intrigued by horoscopes. Knowing about the future before it happened seemed like something magical. 
While exploring more in this direction I bumped on zodiac signs and their characteristics. In one of my zodiac sign(Aries) 
characteristics were written that "one of the weaknesses we have is we take more than we can handle.".

I was like, good thing I read this because now I can work on it and become successful. __16 years__ later I realized how wrong 
I was and how disastrous that text was to me. Almost everyone faces this problem of taking more than they can handle. But what if
the reason someone is not successful is that, they are not pushing themselves beyond their threshold. And the threshold of a 
person depends on their endurance which in turn depends on the level of training one has done.

If you always chose things that do not overburden you. Then every other time your threshold would reduce and you would pick an easier
task. I think this is a philosophy for failure. No one goes to the gym and says to himself I am gonna increase weights
only to the point that they are pleasurable to me. __That's not how it works and if you do it you will never gain muscle.__ . 
If you want to build muscle and reach your dream. You have got to push yourself beyond your limit. 

__Muscles only grow, once they are broken__ . Endurance is a thing which matters a lot in every field, may it be business, science or art. One has to endure through difficult
time. * It doesn't get easy you get stronger.* At the same time, you have got to keep on increasing the limit to help
you reach your goals faster. This is smart work combined with hard work. 

For me I have been sleeping a lot. 8-9 hours when once I used to sleep at most 6. And it seems the reason was I did not want
to overburden myself, which is like saying I want to look buffed up and yet I don't want to work for it. I came to a point whenI worked only 3-4 hours a day and that's when I know I had to change something.

Again what I am saying is other extreme of the spectrum. OverBurdening yourself can sometimes exhaust you completely. Although the only way to know that threshold *when you
__just can't take anymore, is by taking more initially__*. Your target should be to maximize this limit slowly as you would increase 
weights in a gym. Slowly your body will adapt and before you knew it you would lifting double your weight. 

Hence why initialive from now is to do the same. I have been doing this last week and I started working 8-9 hours again and made 
5 projects on a technology I have never worked on. My next challenge would be to work 10-12 hours and sleep 6 hours instead. 
__If you really wan't something you can make it happen.__
