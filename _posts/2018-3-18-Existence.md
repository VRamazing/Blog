I exist
People ask what is the meaning of life
It is mere existence.
The existence of you and I and everything around us
Existence has a start time and end time
And it is at that time that one must make their presence felt 
A presence can be made felt in various ways 
Both with positive and negative consequences 
But the only catch is that it must be felt. 
Just  like a flower has a smell irrespective of whether it smells bad or pleasant
It doesn't care about our opinions or taste and lives with the sole motive of making its presence known.

We must be the same 
We have to make our existence known to the world
In our own way and we are the only one who can
But before we can show that we exist we have to know why
Why do we exist?
Sun exist to spread light
Flowers exist to spread aroma and beauty
Fauna exists to show how dynamic our environment is.
Everything has a purpose. 
And that's how existence is shown
What is ours?
You can either spend years trying to find it
Or you can make something close to your heart a purpose.
Something you can do for the rest of your life.
Something you can never go tired of.
If we don't understand who we are me may never be able to show to the world 
what we are actually capable to do.
And all the modern tools of success would be as good as never found.

Make a list of all the things you are.
Omit the things that you don't want to be known for. 
Use the final list as a guideline to show your existence to the world. 
Show to the world why you exist and why it must acknowledge it.

Do everything that you have wanted to do. 
Express yourself completely ad nothing more. 
Make that song. 
Approach that girl. 
Learn a new skill
Do everything you can to make the universe acknowledge respect you for your existence.

My job is to create as many projects, games, music, art, business as I can. Cause that is the way of showing my existence. I will let it
known by sharing the work that I have put my pasion into. I will challenge the toughest problem and give the best solution to them.
I will shamelessly market because my work could be of value to someone else and in turn, increase my own values.
This is my way to show the world what I am capable of and the world will acknowledge it. It would have no choice but to.
I would not listen to the world when it tries to stop me or put barriers down my path. I would not listen to my mind when it becomes negative
My existence depends on what I produce and I will make sure I keep producing it in the best quality, I can till the last of my breath.

I am Vignesh Ramesh. I wear many hats which include computer programmer, web developer, game developer, artist, musician, an entrepreneur
but the one that I am proud of is Human being. Because I exist and I am glad of it. I will make it known I swear by my life.
