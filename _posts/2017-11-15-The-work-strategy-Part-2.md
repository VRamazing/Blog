I know discipline and patience are important for achieving any feat.Last week I gave 3 hours to each of my priorities though it
seemed I wasn't doing as much as I wanted to do.I felt I was mainly dragging myself through those 3 hours and not getting anything done
.My daily work efficiency reduced to 5 hours from 9 hours.I did felt better than before cause I thought I was giving my best
but I wasn't.Everytime a challenge arise within those 3 hours and usually in the middle.I would procrastinate it to next day 
as I rationalized it to take more than 3 hours.This didn't felt like the right strategy especially not for game development which
persevering through constant failure.

I thought a better strategy would be to plan to give 3 hours to each subject in a day but implement it differently.Suppose I am giving
3hrs each day to game development ,website development and data science.Instead giving 3 hours I can give 2 days to each 
subject.The time allocation would be the same and the work efficiency would be better.It would also help me persevere better 
when a tough topic arises and I feel like procrastinating it and  moving to a different subject or waiting for 3 hour timer 
to turn off.Having 1 pritority per day is better because it gives you quick result as opposed to working 3 hours everyday for a 
week.

I have come accross this conclusion multiple times although I haven't been able to apply the second strategy well.Maybe I should 
add some free space for errors.So from now on 2 days a week is reserved for web development and game development.The rest 3 days 
can be given to either data science,web dev,game dev or just rest according to the need.The main priority is to focus on one task
,one vision a day and reach it at any cost.I have always planned to be efficient 7 days a week and work/study 7 days a week.This
has never been possible and the best I could achieve was 5 days/week and the worst was 4 days/week.Lets see how well I do when 
I have a low target which I know I can easily achieve.
