I feel like my current body is not my body but just an exoskeleton. Helping me to do the tasks that my real body cant to do.My real body seems to be inside me with same size as that of my real body but a different purpose.I had forgotten about my real body and up until now, i thought of my exoskeleton as my real body.
I feel if I move my real body any part of it.My exoskeleton imitates it just like in sci fi movies.

Last night was painful.I felt energy accumulating in my upper back and neck.
Seems to be revolving in that region.I could feel the constant chill on my back. The kind that would give you shivers and make your hair stand.I feel so exhausted I couldn't even wear a sweater.I slept and woke up in 2 hours and it felt like I have been asleep for 6 hours. Seems like so much time had passed away.I slept again.

Woke up sick exhausted with complete body ache. Couldn't do breathing exercise although I did give best. Came to the resolution above.

Right now I can feel the energy flowing through my back. Reaching the head and again heading for bottom chakra and repeating the cycle.The process seems a bit slow on the head. Gotta keep you updated later
