November is over and I had a great month. I joined Gamkedo club and have been continuously involved in the process of game
development. First the awesome courses by Udemy then pixel art animation and music creation.Made 137 contribution in november
and now I need to make 145 more contribution this month to reach 1000 commits on github. Well I am doing everything that I 
always dreamed of doing and life couldn't be better. Although yes I still need to figure out how to make a living and I think
it is super important to me now. I love attending weekly meeting and being accountable to someone else has surely improved by 
productivity aroud 10 folds. 

I have already completed the weekly target I set for this week for gamkedo. Everything seems to 
fall perfectly into place. I am also working on vuetify-firebase course to create a web application. I am 84% done and will try to 
complete rets of the course today. I have been reading bhagwad Geeta everyday for a month and it is changing a lot within me. It
has become a theraupreutic experience. Those 10 minutes I am in a different plane. Still I am just half way through and definetly 
not in hurry. I realized I need to be more patient and at the same time keep working harder and harder to make result appear a bit
faster. So that's what I am doing now, working really hard, to the point of collapse and at the same time having a long term vision 
and being patient like a wise man. At gamkedo I have met countless amazing people. People who are expert in their respective field.
All this wouldn't have happened had I never decided to take a gap year. Although of course fate had some role in it. THank god to 
the blessing I am recieving in last few days. I removed this blog link from my official website as i concluded it was affecting 
my job application. Pretty soon I am gonna get a good job and I am gonna take whatever it is and work hard at it with a precision 
of samurai. I know what I want and after a long time of hiatus it is professional and financial success. I am gonna keep making
awesome games and there are many down the pipeline. Some day I am gonna make money out of all them. Someday I am gonna be rich and
famous but today I just want to enjoy this moment. It took me a long time to figure out my purpose. I really couldn't figure out
why the answer was always no when I asked myself "If today was last day of my life would I do what I am about to do today." . And now
I am happy to say even if today is last day of my life I will die with a smile on my face knowing I have achieved something 
worthwhile to me.
