November is over and I had a great month. I joined Gamkedo club and have been continuously involved in the process of game
development. Completed some awesome courses by Udemy then pixel art animation and music creation. Made 137 contributions in November
and now I need to make 145 more contributions this month to reach 1000 commits on github. Well, I am doing everything that I 
always dreamed of doing and life couldn't be better. Although yes I still need to figure out how to make a living and I think
it is super important to me now. I love attending weekly meeting and being accountable to someone else has surely improved my productivity around 10 folds. 

I have already completed the weekly target I set for this week for gamkedo. Everything seems to 
fall perfectly into place. I have been reading Bhagwat Geeta every day for a month and it is changing a lot within me. It
has become a therapeutic experience. Those 10 minutes I am in a different plane. I realized I need to be more patient and at the same time keep working harder and harder to make result appear a bit
faster. So that's what I am doing now, working really hard, to the point of collapse and at the same time having a long-term vision and
being patient. At gamkedo, I have met countless amazing people. People who are expert in their respective field.
All this wouldn't have happened had I never decided to take a gap year. Although of course fate had some role in it. Thank god to 
the blessing I am receiving in last few days.  I am gonna keep making
awesome games and there are many down the pipeline. Someday I am gonna make money out of all them. Someday I am gonna be rich and
famous but today I just want to enjoy this moment. It took me a long time to figure out my purpose. 

I am happy to say even if today is last day of my life I will die with a smile on my face knowing I have achieved something worthwhile __to me.__
