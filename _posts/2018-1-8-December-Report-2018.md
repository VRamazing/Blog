December started on a low note. Not too many contributions only and choosing to do lazy tasks instead. On the flipside I got 
following done.

1. Prepared first game pitch for gamkedo
2. Made 50+ Contributions.
3. Completed my third Indie Game
4. Made 2 Musical Tracks(Misfortune and Mystery)
5. Completed Bhagwat Geeta(Best book I have ever read)
6. Started learning french
7. Organized first musician meetup.
8. Took $20180 challenge this year and became completely open about it.
9. Started exercising a bit more.
10. Contributed on almost all current games on gamkedo

Trying to make 2018 the best year of my life and I am optimistic it will be. :)
