There is a popular saying "You are the average of 5 people you surround yourself with". I always thought I surrounded myself 
with the right people.One day while going through some introspection I asked myself. What do I mean by right people?
Everyone has a good and bad side.Everyone has strength and weakness.We can learn something from everyone so in a way everyone
is the right person.So why am I not yet successful?

As it turns out you have to carefully pick the people you surround because it is gonna decide whether you are going to be 
successful or not.There are few things you have no control over and this is one of it.The effect the external stimuli has on
the human mind is out of our control.We can limit to some extent by controlling who we interact with.While choosing who you surround 
yourself one must specifically choose people who will take them closer to their ambition ,goal or vision.

As another saying goes "It's better to be last among the best than to be best among last."

While choosing my college I chose the latter approach. I thought being best among last would help me learn better and I would feel  more confident.I still regret that decision.Although being best among last can feel good momentarily.There is next to no improvement and only confidence one feels is superficial and short-lived.In the world that is ever changing, I don't think tthis approach
is viable.

Being the last among best seems strange to pick as it's out of our comfort zone but it is most beneficial.As Steve Jobs used to say
*" The A grade people don't like to hang out with B grade people and vice versa "*
Although if we want to be A grade we must make it a habit to hang out with people better than us no matter what.When we make it a
habit to continuously meet people better than us psychologically it pushes us to work harder towards our goal.
Maybe that's why Mark Zuckerberg took a goal to meet 1 new person every day.Cause it can be a boon to you.

When I graduated I felt nothing.I wasn't happy which was odd.Although I was relieved of leaving that fateful place.What concerned
me more was what was I gonna do next? and working for someone didn't seem like a great idea.I scrolled through my facebook page and
out of 300 friends I don't think any of them were doing work which could be in line with what I thought was great work.
This lead me to wonder if I need to rethink my company and curtail some friends.It seemed tough but I finally did itone fine day and I couldn't have been happier.I deleted my facebook and twitter and recreated them with a different email address
.Stopped replying to people who I thought were either undermining me or draining my energy.Initially, it was hell.
I felt empty but after a while, I started enjoying this new feeling and felt happier. As *nature abhors vaccum* I wasn't alone
for long.With the help of twitter, facebook and github I acquainted many interesting people who have been instrumental to propogate
me forward in my technology career.

If something is important enough to you then you would do anything to achieve it.Similarly, I would do anything within my potential and principles to be a successful tech entrepreneur.I have a dream to one day do business with mark Zuckerberg and Elon musk and I am going tto make
it happen.I am not gonna let other people opinion down me or let someone with a narrow mindset effect me.
