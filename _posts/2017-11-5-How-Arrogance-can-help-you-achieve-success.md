From the birth, we are taught to be humble and it is good thing to respect and treat others as equal .This was the case with me.
Since a child I have believed that everyone knows something more than you and someone is always better than you, so respect it
and don't be arrogant/show off.
I don't know who put that thought into my head.Must have been some loser.This thought would made me a poor competitor and hence
lead to a lot of issues I may need to resolve when I grew up.

The issue is when you believe everyone is better than you and make it ingrain in yourself then it leaves no room for improvement as
no matter what you do their someone will always be better than you.What's the point of working if you can't be good.If taken to an 
extreme this may lead to a fatal loss of confidence and inferiority crises as in my case.This way produces no good output and is
only a means to maintain mediocrity.Maybe that's why they teach this in schools.

A better approach to life involves a bit of arrogance(having or revealing an exaggerated sense of one's own importance or abilities.)
Well this is approach certainly works for me as it gives me more confidence and get works done.When you believe you are more important
and have the abilities that you don't actually have then your brain works for you and makes it a reality.Ultimately what you think about 
you bring about.The World sees you on the basis of how you see and present yourself.
This is the main basis of human psychology and why a lot of arrogant people are successful.Growth occurs only with a 
bit of arrogance.
For me when I am humble without a bit of arrogance (as psychology of everyone better than me) I feel week.I feel good for nothing,depressed 
to the bones.With a bit of arrogance I become perfectly who I want myself to be.A person who is confident in what he does and gets shit done at any cost.
I can do anything and everything with a bit of arrogance.I am unstoppable and care about nothing but my goal.
Yes being overly arrogant is again an issue as it can ultimately lead to a down fall.A person may think he knows too much and no one can ever 
match no matter what they do.This is where humility can help.As the saying goes *Too much of anything can be bad*.

I think ultimately both arrogance and humility is important for survival and how we balance them will decide the outcome of our life.
