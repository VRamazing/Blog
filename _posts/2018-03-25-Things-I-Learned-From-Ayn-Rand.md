I don't know how I picked up Ayn Rand from Amazon to read. It was an impulsive decision to place an order for the same but it was worthwhile.I am glad I ordered and read it. I have no doubt it changed the lives of countless people including me.

Here are some things I learned in the process. 

__1) Follow your passion and achieve it no matter what__

   I was crying most of the time while reading fountainhead by ayn rand. You know before I picked up fountainhead I felt that people just go through life without achieving anything. Dreams are farce. Reality is cruel and the things I have been dreaming were a waste of time.
Why did I felt like that? Most of my reasons for the same was my surrounding(my friend circle used to think the same way). Plus I lacked the perseverance and patience required to achieve the vision. But when I read Fountainhead, I was in tears as I realized my dreams would not be in vain and it is up to me to achieve. The character of the protagonist in the book is so relentless that I felt inspired to action and I started believing more in myself. I said F*** you to the a******* who thought I would amount to nothing. 
I said to myself, * 'I am gonna be an entrepreneur and the question is not who is gonna let me but who is gonna stop me' * which is exactly what the protagonist says for his own profession

__2) Never Give up no matter Long it takes.__

In fountainhead, it took Howard Roarke(Protagonist) 15 years to finally reach his pinnacle and here I was brooding that I have not achieved success after 3 years of knowing the field. This gave me hope for my own future and how bright it can be. I started seeing my life as a blank canvas with an ability to paint it as I want it. This was an amazing feeling. Yes, others seemed to be more successful at the moment but I would be much more happier and prosperous in the long run even if it takes me 20 years.

__3) Be Selfish and Work for your own happiness__

We live in a society which makes us place more significance to the happiness of others instead of ourselves. This usually leads to unsatisfaction and could lead to the disastrous situation. It's your time and no one is gonna give your theirs. Use it to your advantage cause time is all you have. Follow your passion and do the things that make you happy. When you do this your happiness rise from within and it could bring brightness to everyone around you. No matter what, do what you love and let others do what they love. Place your interest above others because if you won't, who will. 

__4) Money is good__

All my life I have listened to don't run after money. Do what you love. But you know that after a while it all boils down to money. Money is the factor by which people govern your success. I realized that money is not evil, what is evil, is not wanting money. When someone doesn't want money, he either has an intention to die or to depend on other person's income. I don't know which one is worse. Ayn Rand refers to such people as moochers and I cringe every time I think or hear don't go after money. 
I would say once you have found your passion(something you could do for the rest of your life), capitalize on it and make as much money as you can. It is gonna help you in future and achieve more happiness. Money is simply a barometer of prosperity and as "Robin Sharma"
says life is meant to be abundant in every way.

__5) No one can give make you suffer without your consent__

This is one of the best idea to take from the book. A lot of time we suffer because we knowingly become victims to our exploiters. Don't do that. You don't have to. You hold complete power over yourself and no one else. Don't try to dominate others, only people with poor self-esteem do that. People who think conquering others would make them conquer themselves. That's why bullies can't stand up when faced with resistance. Don't give them the right to make you suffer. Next time someone says something to ruin your day just ignore them. They are not worth it and merely pebbles on your path to success. Focus on the path. Don't react because if you react they win.
