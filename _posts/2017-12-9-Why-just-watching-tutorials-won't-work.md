Why just watching tutorials won't work?


I have been doing the same thing for past 4 years. Watching tutorials and following them towards completion. Although this 
technique is helpful in learning technology. I don't think this is optimal and feasible everywhere. Its too slow. As of today 
a lot of people @gamkedo were discussing about blockchain. I realised that somewhere down the line if I want to learn a new 
technology then following tutorial and then working on my prototype is comparitively a slow process. I can instead go for start 
working on prototype and then only watch those videos/tutorials that will help me create the product further. Only requiring those 
skills that are helpful to you in the moment. 
Still sometimes its best to follow along in a tutorial as it gives you an idea about how much time it might take for you to complete
a task. It makes you patient. Both skills are equally important. I would try to implement second skill mostly
Following tutorial gives you an understanding of what is the best way to progress in a given technology.

Further I have decided to give time to improve my web prescence to get more gigs online. Now I am a entrepreneur and I have to 
work hard to present myself in such a way. Things are going great but I have to work harder now. I am not working hard enough.
God is with me and will always will be. I am achieving my purpose slowly and day at a time.I have decided to create a  game a week
and tweet it every saturday. Further I can also tweet what 1 great and important thing that I completed that particular day which
made that day worth living. It could be anything from following along a tutorial to create something awesome on your own.
Probably FCC project. My attempt with these tweets would be to reach like minded people and land more gigs. Further in linkedin
I can share awesome blog post that I must write every week which makes it even more important to get my blog ready and web site
updated as soon as possible. Damn I have so little time and so much to do. I have to work more efficiently. I am sleeping a lot.
Probably have to pull a few all nighters and I think today is a good day for it as I don't need to exercise today. Anyways
enough of ranting. Gotta work hard and complete today's work..
