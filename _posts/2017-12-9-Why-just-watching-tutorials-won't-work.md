I have been doing the same thing for past 4 years. Watching tutorials and following them towards completion Although this technique is helpful in learning technology. I don't think this is optimal and feasible everywhere. Its too slow. . No matter how many tutorials I watch the knowledge seem to be incomplete. If I want to get a prototype done for a pet project following this approach might take months at a time. As of today , a lot of people are discussing about blockchain and how it can be of importance to the world. I realised that somewhere down the line if I want to learn a new technology then the following tutorial and then working on my prototype is comparatively a slow process.

I can instead go for start working on the prototype and then only watch those videos/tutorials which will help me create the product further. Only requiring those skills that are helpful to me in the moment. This way I can always pickup any technology that I want, create what I want and forget about it.  This reduces dependence on a particular technology and promotes technological freedom and creativity. As technology is progressing so fast. It doesn't seem prudent to stick to one technology and using this approach can make or save a career. Although this approach is hacky, it gets job done quickly  and mostly produces better results.
