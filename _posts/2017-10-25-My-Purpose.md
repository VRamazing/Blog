I don't know why I get distracted away from my purpose.Probably because I love doing the small steps that take me to my purpose
so much that I think of them as my purpose.

Around this time in 2015 I decided for sure, entrepreneurship is the most important thing to me.It took me a year to finally make this
decision and I took a year off from programming and anything technical to focus on my character, build leadership qualities
and become a more attractive personality.It was difficult as you could see everybody moving forward while you were standing still.
(I later realised we are all moving forward in different direction depending on our vision and action)
It was around that time I become truly rebel.Sacrificing my career if need be.I didn't wanted to be a musician or an engineer.
I wanted to be an entrepreneur who makes the difference to the world and who makes a living doing what he loves.Moreover, I didn't
think someone who get bored easily was suitable for job life.Playing music still, does make me high.It has a similar effect as
meditation or probably drugs does on some people.

After a year or so I realised its time to stop reading books and focus on improving programming as I wanted to create next breakthrough
application and not write a book about creating it.So I gave myself away to programming and loved the process.10 months
have gone by and I almost forgot why I gave so much of my time and energy to programming.Sometimes I feel that depression and boredom
is a way of our soul telling us this is not the path for us or you are getting distracted.I don't feel any happiness to program for
someone.I am happy to program for my vision and I think I am the best person for the job.I am proud to say I am the best person
for the job and I will hire myself. Another thing I have noticed about myself is that if I really want to do something there is nothing
that could stop me and I would craft the best work in the world.On the other hand, if I am given a task that I don't want
to do, I would do the shittiest job in the world.No matter what I do I am not able to change this quality and have finally surrendered to
it for good.

Learning technologies to create a product which would help me earn and at the same time serve someone.
Now that's something I would love to work on.I should write my purpose somewhere in bold so that I never forget it. __Be a technology entrepreneur and make a living out of it__
I have found out why money is important and how it fits in my life.I have learnt that you can be happy and complete without money but 
up to an extent.Even monks need money for survival(Bhiksha).I need money to fulfill my dreams.I can't be anymore happy without
achieving my dreams/my purpose/my meaning.And these things are only possible  if I make money.Money governs everything.Money is power.
(Not that I am a power maniac.Its just the truth.) I can't build a company without an equity which is basically money.I can't build 
a house or make a living without money, I need it.Plus its a good publicity for any entrepreneur.

In my eyes, I have already become successful. I have found my purpose and it's time I pursue it relentlessly and prove it to the world that I am successful.From now on my every action and decision will be towards making money and be a better technology entrepreneur.
And hence my new year resolution is to __make more money than yesterday and overall earn atlease 6 lakhs and to meet 1 new person better 
than me every week.__ in 2018.I know I am gonna make it.
