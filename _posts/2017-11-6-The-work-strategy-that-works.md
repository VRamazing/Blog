I have been writing a lot lately and loving it.Well, I can't help it, whenever I feel I have something happy to record or
some breakthrough understanding I feel a genuine need to write.So here I am again

I don't know why but the focus on 1 thing a day doesn't work well with me.I realized I am most productive and happy when I do
multiple stuff during the complete day.This might be the reason I chose entrepreneurship as a career.Well as I said in my previous post
I usually forget why I made a decision after making it probably because there are so many things going on in my head.

So September and October.These 2 months I chased starting a company like crazy and I put a lot of stress on myself to create 
projects and get results faster.But as it turns out results are only faster if the person has practiced to get them faster and
that practice session may take a looooong time(Extra o's were intentional).The intense stress didn't made me happy or help me be
more productive but instead made me hate my life(a good way to describe depression)

Today I tried something new and my whole world became bright again.I picked each topic that I had been procrastinating and gave 3 hrs
to each of them(game dev,angular 4,data science). I observed I had a lot more fun and I was much more productive than before.I wondered
why I didn't do this before and as it turns out the reason was lack of patience cumulated by fear.Makes me remember this quote.

*"Fear is the path to the dark side.fear leads to anger.Anger leads to hate.Hate leads to suffering." - The Phantom Menace*

Results take time to appear.So my attempt now will be to be more patient and follow this routine for a year and see the result and then 
make a change if need be.
