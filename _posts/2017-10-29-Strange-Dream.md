I had a weird experience last night.I was exhausted as I went to sleep and was asleep in a moment.I don't know how long I was
in unconscious state although what I remember is being rushed through space-time and seeing different colors.I was feeling suffocated
.I knew this was a dream and I can break it. I have broken dreams multiple time with sheer will although it doesn't seem
to work at the moment.I am chanting the name of lord repetedly and still it doesn't work.This is odd.I close my eyes (in dream)
but the pain of rushing through the space is unbearable.

Pretty soon I can't even close my eyes.It feels like the scene from
"2001 A space odessey" when the protagonist finds the ultimate truth.My eyes are forced open to see the reality.I have to experience
this.It is the only way.Like in the movie "The fight club" The only way to go beyond pain is to accept it, embrace it and forget about it.
This was the message I got from my soul."Accept it" it said, it's the only way.I could feel it a dream and I could feel my body asleep.
I could feel the air from the fan and the rest surrounding.Still, my eyes were closed and my dream eyes was rushing forward.
I was in sleep paralysis.I was afraid if I don't break this I would forever be stuck in this state.My Spaceship(me) was rushing
faster through space and the colors appeared weirder and seems to merge into one another.

Finally, I heeded my calling and accepted the worse.Let the worse may come, I am not afraid.I won't fight you but instead, accept you
with open arms and give all the love you have been robbed of.I could finally close my eyes and a smile sprang across my face.My spaceship slowed down and became still.Colors vanished and merged into pure white.I could breathe again and better.I realized I could finally break
the dream and get up which I did.I woke up and I have never felt more alive in my life.

I went back to sleep peacefully and woke up next morning to check if someone else has experienced such a sleep paralysis.The thought that
kept springing to my head was kundalini.So I checked Reddit and many people do report such incidents.It's possible that last night I experienced
enlightenment like the protagonist from "2001 A space odyssey". When I woke up I was happy with my life and how far I had come.This was unlike me
as I usually am a bit competitive.I feel content and happy from inside.Maybe I have become enlightened or
maybe this is just a start.
