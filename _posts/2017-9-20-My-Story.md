I really wanted to get into IIT but I understood this after I had already failed once and taken a drop year and was already
halfway through the drop.Before that, I was involved in meaningless tasks which would just give me immediate satisfaction.
I wanted to show people that I was successful, smart and superior to them.I didn't know that this was how people failed.I got into the worst college I could have chosen where most of
the people had negative attitudes towards life.The attitude that would surely take them to the bottom of the human pyramid.
In college, I had already given up thinking that if you don't get into IIT then you don't stand a chance in life.You will never
amount to anything big in life. My surrounding believed that too. Can't blame them well we are all victims to negativity.But
we don't always have to. I decided I won't be anymore. I decided I was born to be an entrepreneur and I am gonna be best at
this one task. Further, I want to be technology entrepreneur because that's the reason my intuition guided me to computer science.

From that day on I have been struggling. I had struggles keeping friends as I just could tolerate mediocrity neither in myself
nor in others.If someone can't help being mediocre at least they can try not to.People are lazy and complacent and that's
the reason for lack of growth of our society.Anyways I dove into college course to understand how technology actually works
and how I can utilize it for my future business. Unfortunately, there was no practical benefit for college studies.Although I
did develop the qualities necessary for a leader to survive.I learned to be my own teacher and how to survive alone.


Still, I am struggling.I have learned a lot and I don't think there is an end to it.I will always keep learning and the process will never complete even when I am dead. I can't convince myself to do a job.I don't think I am happy with building someone else's dream at least not at the moment.I have my own dream and I must spend all my resources to that.The fear haunts you sometimes.What will happen I fail
I have decided this is my path and the sooner I accept it the faster I am gonna each my destination.Risk will always exist.
To live is to risk you will die.We are here to take control of fear and not the other way around.So life has left me only one option.The only way I can be truly happy is by hustling.Money doesn't motivate but making a difference does.

I have to be self-sufficient and support myself. I was afraid of this but I guess this s the only way. It's time to light up my way and give up everything that's holding me back.
