Well, I remember vaguely how forcing myself to not copy from other people works was such an obstacle in my path of learning to program. My philosophy anything that I make would be completely mine. This lead me to a slow progress in learning to program. While learning a sorting algorithm I would try to implement everything from scratch just after reading the description. This although was a good exercise for a novice programmer, it was quite slow taking into consideration the depth of computer science as a whole. For someone who was learning programming to become an entrepreneur, this meant death. 
While others were getting well versed with latest technology I was wondering if I was the dumbest person on earth for being so slow. In a way, I was, as all I was doing was trying to reinvent the wheel. 

Copying from others is an art that we as a primate developed in primal age. The necessity of survival depended upon how quickly one learns to walk or climb a tree. In present world, this importance of learning from copying is being forgotten. We see copying as stealing, as something hideous and unacceptable. 

On the flipside copying or learning by copying is the only way to mastery. Think of yourself when you were a child. If you hadn't looked at your parents, brothers or sisters and observed(learned) how they could walk on two legs, you would have never been able to walk. This might not seem a big issue looking back and we might think of this as a hypothetical situation but the direness of the situation is real.
As we grew we learnt to talk like other people and sometimes behave like others. There is even a saying we are an average of 5 people we surround ourself with. Learning from copying someone is in our psyche and we all do it subconsciously. Then why is it given a bad name?
 
I am not saying its right to copy and claim someone else's work as yours. That is not copying, it's manipulation and sooner or later the truth comes in front of all.

What I am saying is to learn by copying masters. If you want to learn to program. Find the best programmers online. Read their code and try to recreate their work. That's how we learned to walk as well. Didn't we? From the masters of walking.  If you are a designer. Go to dribble. Find your favorite artist. Try to recreate their work and try to give your own touch to it. Slowly as you tread on this path you will find some ways that are more suited to your style and represent who you really are.

All great masters be it Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare, started like this and in this way they surpassed the people they learnt from and became masters themselves. I urge you to not be afraid of copying and at the same time not to take it for granted as the only skill you may have. 

*TL;DR Don't be afraid to copy and yet at the same time don't forget to add your own essence to the work you produce*

__Your work is a representative of who you are. When everything is lost and forgotten your work will remain. Make sure it inspires anyone who comes across it.__
