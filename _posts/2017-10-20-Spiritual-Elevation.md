October third week and nothing satisfactory got done this week.Although last week was teriffic.This week seems to be such a bore
Maybe I need to bring back the fixed holidays strategy and motivate myself to work towards it like I did last week.
It was really powerful.I don't know I can't seem to motivate myself to work this week.It got really depression plus I was
going through ascession symtoms so I used to sleep early and wake up late to ease the pain.I will probably write another 
post about my spiritual experiences.I believe I am really close to the climax.Hope this ends soon.

Working on anymore projects don't seem to motivate me.Everything seems similar and boring.Things that seemed to excite me don't 
seem to excite me anymore.In such a state what should a person do. I am not depressed, I feel happy when I sit idle and  be present 
in the moment.I used to feel contrary in the past as I was a kind of person who likes to utilize most of his time.At present
forcing myself to work depresses me to lowest bottom(Wishing I was dead instead). I don't think such a state is good on a long term.
Hence I didn't work ana I am not working at the moment.I guess its best for me to enjoy present while it last.Time seems to slow
down to ultra slow.It seems life is going  at 20 frames/second while I am moving at 60 fps.

I feel better by just writing this.I am noticing things that I have never before.Things of beauty in daily life that anyone could
have ignored.The whole world seems to be running while I seem to be sitting still looking through the eyes of innocent child waiting 
for someone to arrive.I have stopped seeing numbers everywhere or maybe I just got used to it.In the beginnng of this month I used to
see a lot of numbers with triplets(333,444,555).With someone with math background this seemed a bit odd.Cause that's ultra low proabability.
Now I feel is everything is one and one is everything.I might have read it somewhere but this seems to be true.I am seeing god in everything
and after a while all numbers seemed to be same.I would see symmetry,perfection and beauty in everything.It just seems you need to look
closely.I don't think I am crazy although if I am I seem to be happier than ever in this state.I am much more productive than I had been 
in past and have achieved exceptional analytical and logical skills.Its seems my brain is rewiring everyday.The change is so great.It made 
me think if I had autism in past.My relationship with the community are improving and reforming.I am going back into the society.
Maybe there is a name to everything I am going through although my research and intuition is leading me to the word "Spiritual Enlightenment."
