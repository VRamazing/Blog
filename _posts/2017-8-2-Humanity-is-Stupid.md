Yes you guessed it right Humanity is stupid and its our fault.A species that evolved through millions of years and which 
eventually placed more significance on brain a brawn.
As Einstein quoted we are becoming a generation of smart phones and dumb people.We are morphing into incapable fools 
who can't accomplish a simple task without computers.
We are loosing our biggest strength our intelligence and focusing too much on outward satisfaction and wordly pleasure 
instead of working on our own self. Think about it has there been a significant discovery in the past 2 decades.Noooo.
Why? Most of us have stopped thinking or stop being smart.

The reason we have stopped using intelligence is firstly we don't know how smart we actually are and secondly we can't 
find the right reason to use it.Partying hard till blackout is neither right way nor right reason to use it.

First things first we have to stop using negative affirmation and things that affects our subconscious like weeds affects 
gardens.Things like I so stupid? I am not smart? affects our mind and becomes our reality. 
Even Einstein became himself by thinking and holding himself in high regard even when no one else thought he was even fit 
to even teach students.We are all born intelligent we just have forgotten how to use that intelligence.

Purpose is also important for any form of intelligence to exist.Like peter parker used to say."With great power comes great 
responsibility".We have to find the right reason to use it.
Like the muscles in our body develop and take shape only if we condition our body to continuous exercise.The mind is similar 
and Unless we constantly challenge it to new limits it won't grow.And to challenge it we must first know WHY?

My Why? is I want to the best entrepreneur and business magnate the world has seen and I will be.I am into technology(I love it) at the 
moment and I may foray into other fields.I am inspired a lot by elon musk and like him I swear I will never give up.
When I solve any programming problem I used to close it by saying It's too tough & I am not that intelligent.Not anymore!!!.
From now on there are couple more affirmation that are going down on my list.
"I am the smartest man on this planet"
"I will never give up.I will get my balls eaten than give up"
"I can easily solve any programming problem thrown at me easily"

Affirmations have power to change reality if done right.Lets see what the result shall be in a year.
