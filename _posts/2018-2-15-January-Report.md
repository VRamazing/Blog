Its middle of Feb and I am a bit late in writing this report. I will try to keep this as possible. Almost entirety of January I was focussed on making money and getting a job. I felt working on the side could generate necessary money that could be used in my startup plus I would be in touch with the core web technologies.
 When I finally got a job I thought was good for me and could probably change my life, I was disheartened by the work required for me to do. The work I was supposed to do, did not in any way improved my growth or could have made me a better technology person(at least in technologies I am willing to market myself in). Plus the pay wasn't as good as the workload which left me no incentive to keep working. So I quit. My decision had nothing to do with the quality of people in that particular company. They were the best people I ever met. It's just that I did not feel we had the same future.'

One thing I did learn at the job is __"You are not gonna love everything you do but to get to where you want, you have to do everything you can."__ I have become much more perseverant and a better organizer.

In the meantime, I met some people around my age who were doing a great job as first-time entrepreneurs even though in some way they were not as knowledgeable or resourceful as me. This made me thinking - what is stopping me to start my own company? 
A bit of introspection made me realize it was nothing but a hill climbing issue. In the beginning of climbing a hill you need to apply a lot of effort to gain the momentum and once you have reached the top you could take advantage of that momentum. 
I just need this. I need to work hard and hard through tears and blood. In the beginning the harder I work the better it is. Once I have gained the momentum necessary which would be in 35-60 days if I follow my plan correctly, I can take complete advantage of my situation.

A couple of days ago I was browsing through quora and I read a beautiful article which said - __To be a good entrepreneur you have to be first good at failing to get a job.__ That's what my attempt would be from now on.
I have started planning every hour of my day in an excel sheet and I am regularly completing and adding activities to it based on the priority of particular activity. Let's see how far I am gonna get in next month. One thing is for sure. I am giving 100% and I am going to keep giving 100% till I achieve my vision.
