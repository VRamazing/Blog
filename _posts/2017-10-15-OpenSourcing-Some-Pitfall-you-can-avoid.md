I got started with open source community with Hacktoberfest which is an event organized by Digital Ocean in collaboration with github.
It was really great to contribute to so many interesting projects but it lead me to wonder why had I been procrastinating open source 
contribution up until now.
So here are a couple of excuses I kept on making, that you could avoid.


__1. I am not good enough__

  Stop saying you are not good enough to contribute to open source.There are projects ranging from pretty darn easy to complex 
  tough and it is up to you to take them.The best thing about contributing to open source is that you can meet a lot of great people
  who can inspire you to learn even more than you would on your own.Just make that first PR and get started and see what open source 
  could do for you.Trust me it takes just 5 minutes it's that easy and after that sky is the limit to what you can do.
  
__2. It takes too much time and commitment__
  
  This is false.You can give 6-7 hours a week and get a lot done.Just stop watching that favourite TV show of yours and instead make
  a couple PR's for a week.I can assure you will feel a lot more content with yourself .Plus you can always catch up with your show later :D

__3. It's too complicated__

  Sometimes we rush to things so quickly that it seems to be much more complicating than it actually is.A better alternative is to 
  take one small step at a time to get started.No one ever stumbled on a small step.
  
__4. It's not that important__

  Contributing to open source has many advantages and the most important of all is that you learn to write better code because your code is accepted only if community approves it.You are forced to follow best practices which is an important skill as this is what employers look for in new candidates.Contributing to open source can be the most important thing you can do today.
