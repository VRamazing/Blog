Stay Hungry stay foolish.That is a  statement people associate with Steve Jobs and his terrific commencement speech at Stanford.
I couldn't understand the meaning of this statement for long.What does it mean? Does it mean one has to always remain hungry to be
successful and always take a foolish decision?Well, Einstein used to say contrary.
Anyways my struggle to find the meaning of life and my role in it lead me to find the actual meaning.For those who are still struggling.

One should be hungry enough to try new things and foolish enough to take the risk to implement what you have learned.Because without implementing one can't learn.My belief is life is meant to reach our true potential which can only be achieved by learning and
continuously improving yourself.
