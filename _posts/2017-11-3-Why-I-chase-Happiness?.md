Just to clarify why I am selfish and prefer following my happiness at any cost once and for all.

2 years ago I had a serious depression.I did not feel like doing anything.I did not had a purpose in life and I didn't knew where I was headed.My friend used to mock me "What's 
the point of traveling when you don't know where you are traveling to".I felt till now I was following the crowd and going whichever
location seemed most secure.Naive as I was.Months passed by and I still couldn't find my purpose.I was feeling suffocated and finally, the 
point came When I could no longer live with myself. The ego Death.The loss of self as Ekhart Tolle calls it.I made a list of things that would
give me most happiness if achieved cause what's the point of living if you are not happy.A child lives to be happy maybe that why he/she
smiles better than most adults.I rearranged the list from easiest to achieve to most difficult to achieve and I went on checking them off 
one after another.Basically, I did not want to live anymore and at that moment I tricked my brain/my self into challenges which once I achieved 
I could die peacefully.

It was simmilar to this scenario
Man(Suicidal) : I don't want to live any more.(About to jump from the building top.)
Man(Helper)   : But you haven't started living yet.
Man(Suicidal) : What do you mean?
Man(Helper)   : Have you seen New Zealand
Man(Sucidal)  : No
Man(Helper)   : They say they have really soft grass which when you fall on ,you wouldn't feel anything.So If you really want
                to give up your life.You can go to New Zealand and jump from a roof on the grass and die peacefully.This, what you 
                are doing is simply a painful death.
Man(Sucidal)  : Thinks...
Man(Helper)   : If you get down now we can plan the trip together.

Eventually, the suicidal man gives in and started seeing world from different eyes from what he hasn't noticed and slowly 
starts loving the world for what it is instead it is not.
