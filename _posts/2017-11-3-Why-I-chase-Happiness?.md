2 years ago I had a serious depression.I did not feel like doing anything.I did not had a purpose in life and I didn't knew where I was headed. My friend used to mock me "What's 
the point of traveling when you don't know where you are traveling to". I felt till now I was following the crowd and going whichever
location seemed most secure. Naive as I was. Months passed by and I still couldn't find my purpose.I was feeling suffocated and finally, the 
point came When I could no longer live with myself.I had an ego death. The loss of self as Ekhart Tolle calls it. I made a list of things that would
give me most happiness if achieved cause what's the point of living if you are not happy. A child lives to be happy maybe that why he/she
smiles better than most adults .I rearranged the list from easiest to achieve to most difficult to achieve and I went on checking them off one after another. I  felt so happy with the result that I decided to always follow my heart no matter what . I was reborn and decided to never waste this beautiful life.
