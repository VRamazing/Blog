We all have past events that we wish we could forget but we just can't. Some people try intoxication for same. There is even a sci-fi concept of erasing memories which have been shown in movies like "Eternal Sunshine of Spotless mind".

But what if the reason the past keeps on recurring to you is that there is a lesson that you have failed to learn. This is a bit strange idea, that I have been experimenting with lately. What if life wants you to learn from your mistakes and till you do it, you are gonna be stuck in past.

Well, I had this idea really back in 2015 when I was frustrated for choosing the wrong college. I thought my life is over as I did not make it into premier colleges. No matter what I just couldn't forget the day I made the decision. It kept recurring to me every day as vivid as the day. One day I asked myself what can I learn from that incident. What followed were series of answers that would change my life and how I see this world. If I had merely forgotten of it(even though I couldn't), I would have never learned the lessons that life had planned for me and most probably I would have found myself in similar scenario again which would have frustrated me even more. As I learned the lessons, the memory of that incident slowly faded away like it was always meant to. And trust me, I have never been as calm.

Memory is the most beautiful thing given to us. Use it to improve yourself.

I recently found myself back into the state of recurring past. There was this girl I really liked and it seems she did not had the same feelings for me. I thought to myself OK no problem and tried to forget about it. But don't know why I just couldn't forget her. My heart seems to be saying, you haven't learned the lesson yet(Well it did say a lot of things besides that :D). I thought a lot about what the lesson could be and yet I couldn't find it. Finally yesterday morning I had a complete understanding of what happened and why. I learned the lesson to the incident, 7 months after it happened. Now I feel free, relaxed and complete. Now I feel I can move on with a smile on my face.

Once you have learned the lesson. Don't blame yourself for the incident. Tell yourself, you did the best with the information you had at the moment. Forgive yourself and move to the next awesome opportunity.
