Hello there, Thanks for joining.

I have been exploring a lot of game development resources online and reading a lot of blogs. Don't know why but game development kind of clicks with me. There must be some reason why I stay up all night to make games even though I am not paid. Tonight I was going through this amazing course on coursera about Entrepreneurship and Games by Michigan State University. 
This amazing course had such great insights that I highly recommend it. 

One of the possible reason for getting so much involved with gamedev is that I get to completely express myself. I get to design music, gameplay, art and be in control of my creation. Never actually getting bored. Helps me with a bit of ADHD. Plus I have amazing friends and community and friends that I can collaborate with. But the question again comes down to money. How will I make money?

I am happy with what I am doing with my time but I am not happy that I am not earning anything. I don't like to be dependent on my parents. I should have been self sufficient by now. This is what disgusts me. Well the only solution lies in doing game dev after office hours and earning any way possible the rest of my hours. 

I have been through this loop on and off. But I guess this is the only way. I have to make money in any and every way possible. I gave myself 1 year to start a business and I failed. Now there is just 1 month left and still no business to run. I can make excuses but that won't suffice. I can look at the bright side but how good can that be. 

Anyways maybe I could make a game in 1 month and release it on steam. But the chance of it becoming successful and me making money is still pretty low. I don't think I could pull it off. Maybe I can. There is no harm in trying.  

This week I taught myself "How to do the things you don't like doing". It was so difficult that I was crying while doing the task. Begging myself to not make me do it. But it was important. Every task can not be done for pleasure. Some tasks need to be done even though they may cause momentary pain. That was good. 

Maybe I could use the same skill doing things that I don't like doing but would need to do. 

And well the list is pretty long.
