Hello, this is my first post on my blog.I have made multiple attempts to blog and till now it's not been a good experience.I thought writing as a way to earn and gain popularity.Naive as I was.I never understood the beauty of writing or sharing.There were many weakness that I possessed and in turn converted into strengths in the past 4 years. 

I have taught myself to trust and follow my heart and my heart has lead me back to where I started from. It may seem like a waste of time to outside eye but sometimes you need to wait for the right reason to do a task cause the fruit you bear then has a greater significance.Like a man working for the love of it creates better result the man who works to just get by.
I would be posting anything that I feel in my heart.The topics may range from philosophy, rant of technologies, politics, psychology, leadership,business, and entrepreneurship.I hope you like what I am doing and if you don't it doesn't matter because there will always be one person who will love it and that's me.
