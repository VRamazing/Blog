Hello this is my first post on my blog.I have made multiple attempts to blog and till now its not been a good experience.I thought writing as a way to earn that someday you could monetize what you write and hence become popular.Imaginative and Creative as I was.I never understood the beauty of writing or sharing.There were many weakness that I poccessed and inturn converted into strengths in the past 4 years. I have taught myself to trust and  follow my heart and the heart has lead me back to where I started from. It may seem like a waste of time to outside eye but sometimes you need to wait for the right reason to do a task cause the fruit you bear then has a greater significance.Like a man working for the love of it creates better result the a man who works to just get by.
I would be posting anything that I feel in my heart.The topics may range from philsophy,rant of technologies,politics,psychology,leadership,business and entrepreneurship.I hope you like what I am doing.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
