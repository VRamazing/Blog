Focus is a concept that everyone proclaims that we must haev to achieve great success but what does it means to have great focus.
Multitasking is a myth and I have faced it. To have complete focus in a task you need to know following things. 
Why am I  doing this task?
How it can make your future better?
Why it is much more important than other tasks?

When you know these things, you can persevere better. It becomes like a puzzle in game that you must solve to see the rest of the game.
Further it is easier to reach the state of flow(A situation where you lose track of time and all you care about is worl)

Only disadvantage with this approach is that you forget and lose your momentum once you complete that state. So its better to keep a list of things that you would complete in the entire day or week. It's really important you give complete attention to what you are doing and not get distracted. Focus means concentrating your attention on one thing. Plus once you complete that task you can always move to the task you are so attracted to work on.
