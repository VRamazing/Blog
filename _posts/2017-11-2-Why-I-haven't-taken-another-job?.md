So here I am looking for part-time work and internships to support my other interesting endeavours and I get a call from some 
Entrepreneur who could use my resources and no matter what , the question he sticks on is Why did I leave the healthcare startup 
I was once employed in? and why I am not employed if I claim to be so good?

Well One of the best things about me is when I make a decision I put my complete mind and attention to it and even think about 
how that particular decision will affect me somewhere in the future.Once I have made the decision I tend to forget anything about 
why I made that decision and just trust myself on why I made it.

And here's this guy asking me why I made a particular decision 6 months ago and I can't recall anything.I said whatever I did in
past was an attempt to make myself happy which was true but I guess not satisfactory.So here it is all the Why?

Since college I had an innate desire to be an entrepreneur and crazy techie who would one day be super rich and probably rule the 
world.I am not at fault.Media taught us that we all can be rich and famous which probabilistically is false.Somewhere I knew this 
but I also knew that we create our own future.

"If you want to think.Think BIG"- My Teacher used to say.That is the only thing I ever learned from that teacher and I am happy I 
implemented it.So from college I have been visualizing having what I thought was a successful life and it seemed foolish to take up
a job and follow someone else's vision when you have your own and it doesn't align with theirs.

My first on-site internship at healthcare startup seemed to be inline with what I wanted my future to be.Plus my heart said take it.
I hated taking that job but that was the only way to be more disciplined and learn how a startup work.I also haven't coded for a year
and it seemed like a great opportunity to learn.So I was excited the first few days.I was happy as I made a lot of friends which at 
the moment I thought would be my friends forever.I loved getting paid for what I love to do.It's like you are being paid twice.
This moment seemed to give me much more happiness than in past but soon it died away.After 2-3 months I felt something was missing.I
felt wasn't completely happy.

So Every time I checked an item off.The happiness I felt was like finding an oasis in a middle of a desert.I asked myself
why the heck are people wasting their lives feeling shitty and doing things that don't make them happy while happiness lies right
in their pocket.I swore that day to always follow my heart 

So here I was working for a company who thought they were making a difference.I should have been happy.I was making a difference too.But I was 
not.I had forgotten my vision and what I was born to do.I tried to forget about it like we all do in our lives but after following my heart 
for almost a year this was close to impossible.So while other people were enjoying their life basically(earning and partying till midnight)
I was here feeling out of place and wondering what I am doing with my life.I decide to take action and give 2-3 hrs everyday to getting close to 
starting a company.I have been doing this for more than a year but now it felt all the more important.My desire to start a company affected my 
output in company working hours which eventually lead to my internship not being conerted to a job opportunity.I wasn't sad
I was happy.It turns out the company was working on out-dated technology and gaining experience in it would be like gaining experience
in cobol these days.

After that I got countless opportunities for varying CTC anywhere from 3-9 lakhs p.a. High paying jobs wanted me to be in bangalore
which I didn't wanted to go to and the jobs that I got around Delhi NCR I didn't went to.Most probably because I didn't felt my talents would be
best used in a 9-5 job.Sometimes I rejected jobs because I did not like the technology they were working on, somethimes because of the salary
they were paying and sometimes because it did not felt right to do it.My fears were leading me to apply for jobs I didn't wanted to go to and my 
anxiety and depression were stopping me to join them.
Once a friend got me a job I didn't ask for and I rejected it.He was like what do you want from life.I said I wanted to be happy.
It was hard for me to go against the wind.There were many sacrifices I had to make but it was fruitful and worth living.I learnt technologies I 
wanted to learn which I could not have if I had chosen to work for someone else.Plus I am more happier than before.
If today was the last day of my life I would die with a smile on my face thinking I made the most out of it and  have no regrets.


There is a reason why happiness is always referred with pursuit.My pursuit so far has been great and worth it.I request you to join me in this pursuit.
Your path may be different than mine but I can assure you it will be as fruitful for you as it has been for me.
