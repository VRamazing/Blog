I have been constantly contributing to github since i graduated.I wish I would have contributed to github in college although 
at that moment I was busy with things that I thought were more important to be at that moment.Some of them being developing 
my overall personality,learning to play guitar,Fighting introvertness,anxiety,depression and other stupid disorders I developed
because of my stupid actions of past.Well one of the reason that stopped me from contributing to open source was "I don't know 
enough". I was repeating the same affirmation and it was becoming a reality. Moreover my friend circle included people
who were officially programmers but in reality were content with printing hello world.

All this changed when I decided to lose my current friend circle(it was tough) because you are the average of 5 people you 
surround yourself with.This small step made me loo at the world differently.As nature abhors vaccum. In a short time my life 
got filled up with many interesting people,most of whom became my inspiration. I decided to not take a job because I felt an urgent 
need to work on my skills and become  better quickly.Further I hate monotonicity. I hate it so much that I  get bored peeing in
the same toilet and I use two toilets in my house interchangably. It gives me some satisfaction. May be I am wierd although I 
prefer unique.

And hence my exploration began with google as my life guide and twitter as my new friend who would introduce me to the world of 
possibility.In one such exploration I got introduced to Hacktoberfest which is a 1 month long challenge to introduce people to
github.I signed up and the motivation for me initially was to get the t shirts as I never got one.This was something new to me.
And there I went exploring again on how to submit a PR which until now was a daunting task for me.My first PR was to update a 
README file and I was like man this is so exciting and fun.I felt so good to finally start contributing.I was filled up with life 
again.In my excitement I thought why not learn Git PR process from both sides.Why not help others like me.So I started igameproject
and opened it to other open source enthusiasts and guess what, contributions pour like rain.It was an amazing feeling.I made 54 contribution
in a day.My all time high and people still contribute to the repo.I felt like I was given a sip of ambrosia.The world of possibility
was right in front of my eyes.I completed hacktoberfest by making 4 commits within 2 days.Currently going on 8.Without Richard Stallman
and Linus Torvolds I don't think this would have been possible.Thats what I want to do in life.Contribute to the whole world in my own way

I have continued the process and now registered for chingu collabs and fossassia.Its expect it be a fun journey.I am learning new technologies
everyday and I don't think my life could have been better.I guess the hardest part of my life is over and the fun part has already 
begun.:D
